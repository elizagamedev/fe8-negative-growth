# Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Negative Growth Hack

This is a challenge hack for FE8 that makes character stats decrease on
level-up rather than increase. Additionally, units can be promoted at any
level, not just when they reach level 10.

Shortly after I made this, I realized that [another hack was just recently
created](https://feuniverse.us/t/fe8-negative-growths/4547). Oh well.
